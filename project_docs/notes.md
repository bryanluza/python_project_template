# Notes
- Really good and comprehensive writeup pinned on Gemini
- Most commands can be run with -v for a more verbose output (e.g. `uv run pytest -v`)
- Run `uv run pre-commit install` to set up the Git hooks. Then, every git commit will automatically run these checks.
- Pytest Fixtures for setting up test environments and data.
- Integrate pytest-cov to track test coverage. This will help you understand how much of your code is being tested.
- Gradually increase strictness for tools as you get more comfortable
- Lots of autogenerated folders (like xx_cache) include `.gitignore` files so they don't need to be added to main `.gitignore`
- Makefile very simple but great place to grou commonly used commands and probably helpful as projects grow.
- docs/
- `uv run sphinx-build -M html .\docs\ .\docs\_build` Works for now, need to understand better make html works too.

# Ideas
- Look for other dev tools that may be worth including
- Look into using {{}} placeholders, see why they use that format and how to laverage them (using them on LICENSE)
- Check what `uv sync` does
- Look into tags and releases for GitHub repos
- Make docs usage page somewhere (same for other commands?)
- Look into docs todos and other tools added

# TODO
- Check .gitignore when done and after running some tests as they will create other files
- makefile

## Placeholders/Variables to look at when done
1. pyproject.toml
- name = "PROJECT_NAME"
- description = "PROJECT_DESCRIPTION"
- authors' name an email
- target-version = "py313"
- python_version = "3.13"
2. LICENSE
- Copyright (c) {{ YEAR }} {{ AUTHOR }}
3. .python-version

 # Done
- Added `CHANGELOG.md` based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
- Setup `pyproject.toml` tools
- Setup `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Setup `Makefile` with basic commands
- Initial docs/ setup
