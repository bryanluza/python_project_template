# Python Project Template

## Introduction
I'm currently developing a personal Python project template, aiming to incorporate best practices and conventions. My goal is to convert this template into a GitHub template for efficient project initiation.

## Key Technologies & Tools:

- Project/Package Manager: uv
- Development Dependencies: ruff, pre-commit, pytest, mypy (Open to suggestions for additional tools)
- Project Dependencies: pydantic, pydantic-settings (Open to suggestions for additional tools)
- License: MIT
- Other Considerations: Plan to include a Makefile for common tasks

## My primary areas for questions will be:
- Python best practices and conventions.
- Effective usage and integration of the tools listed above.
