**This is a temporary file to keep track of things while I'm working on the development of this project.**
**Relevant information will be moved to README file and this file will be deleted from template**

# TODO
- Add tags and/or releases on GitHub repo.
- Research if there a way to use placeholders on the GitHub template or if it has to be done manually. If manually, we should have a detailed section on the README file.(*)
- Check .gitignore when done and after running some tests as they may create other files to be ignored.
- Improve example script and tests to demostrate tools in action.

**(*)**Current Placeholders
