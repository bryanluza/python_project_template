**This is a temporary file to keep track of things while I'm working on the development of this project.**
**Relevant information will be moved to README file and this file will be deleted**
# Notes (likely for README)
- Run `uv run pre-commit install` to set up the Git hooks. Then, every git commit will automatically run these checks.
- Makefile very simple but great place to group commonly used commands and probably helpful as projects grow.
- Lots of autogenerated folders (like xx_cache) include `.gitignore` files so they don't need to be added to main `.gitignore`
- Gradually increase strictness for checking tools as you get more comfortable
- Most commands can be run with -v for a more verbose output (e.g. `uv run pytest -v`)

# Ideas
- Look into using {{}} placeholders, see why they use that format and how to laverage them (using them on LICENSE)
- Check what `uv sync` does
- Look into tags and releases for GitHub repos
- Make docs usage page somewhere like README.md (same for other commands?)
- Look into docs todos and other tools added
- See if it's a good idea including relevant project docs somewhere in the repo (maybe add it all to readme?)
- Look into using logging instead of print statements.
- Add .github directory and implement GitHub CI workflows


# TODO
- Check .gitignore when done and after running some tests as they will create other files
- Test makefile
- Update README (see sections marked as "TODO")
- Docs usage documentation to README
- Improve example script and tests to demostrate tools in action.

## Placeholders/Variables to look at when done
1. pyproject.toml
- name = "PROJECT_NAME"
- description = "PROJECT_DESCRIPTION"
- authors' name an email
- target-version = "py313"
- python_version = "3.13"
2. LICENSE
- Copyright (c) {{ YEAR }} {{ AUTHOR }}
3. .python-version
4. Look for more, list is not full.

 # Done
- Added `CHANGELOG.md` based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
- Setup `pyproject.toml` tools
- Setup `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Setup `Makefile` with basic commands
- Setup `docs/`
